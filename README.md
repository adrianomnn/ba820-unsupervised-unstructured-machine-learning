# BA820: Unsupervised and Unstructured Machine Learning

Empowering Chart to Insights with Multi-Modality Models

- Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of interpreting different types of charts. Specifically, our model identifies chart formats, extracts x-y variables, and captures complex variables when necessary. Additionally, the model analyzes titles and trends in the graphs to determine whether the chart reflects positive or negative business feedback. This work addresses the difficulty and inefficiency experienced by individuals who struggle to understand visualizations, ultimately providing a more intuitive understanding of charts.

- Objectives

Chart Format Identification: Classify the type of chart (e.g., bar, line, pie).
Variable Extraction: Extract and interpret x-y axis variables.
Trend Analysis: Analyze the trends indicated by the chart to determine if the feedback is positive or negative.
Feedback Classification: Generate insights based on the visual data (e.g., if the chart conveys positive or negative business feedback).
Evaluation: Evaluate different models manually or using AI Agent to evaluate each otherâ€™s output 

- Motivation

The complexity and variety of data visualizations make them difficult for many individuals to interpret accurately. Our project addresses these challenges by automating the process of chart analysis, thereby providing users with an easy-to-understand interpretation of visual data.
